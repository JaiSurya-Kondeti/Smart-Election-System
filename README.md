A Smart Election Voting System using Python and machine learning incorporates face recognition to ensure secure voting. 
The system uses pickle to serialize and store labeled face data and trained models. 
A K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is applied for face classification.
When a voter is detected via a webcam, their face is matched against stored data.
After successful authentication, the vote is recorded in a CSV file along with the timestamp. 
The system uses OpenCV for real-time video processing, ensuring robust and efficient facial recognition. 
Text-to-speech provides confirmation of successful voting. 
This approach ensures secure, transparent, and automated voting processes.
